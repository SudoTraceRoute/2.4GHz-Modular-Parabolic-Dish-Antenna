## ⚠️ Build Disclaimer

This is **not** a beginner project. The parts you see in this repository are **not ready-to-use straight from a 3D printer**.

To successfully build this antenna, you should already have experience with:

- **Drilling and cutting metal parts** (e.g., waveguide can, brackets)
- **Sanding and finishing 3D printed parts** to fit tolerances
- **Soldering** coaxial connectors (e.g., SMA/RP-SMA)
- **Basic electrical knowledge** (impedance, polarity, shielding)
- **Some understanding of Wi-Fi theory** (e.g., polarization, wavelength, antenna gain)

> If you're not already comfortable with these skills, I strongly recommend practicing them on simpler projects first.

### 🧱 What This Project Is:
- A hands-on experiment in building a high-gain directional Wi-Fi antenna
- A foundation for more advanced wireless/RF work
- A portfolio project showing practical IT/hardware skills

### ❌ What This Project Is Not:
- A plug-and-play antenna kit
- A no-tools-required project
- A suitable entry point for someone with no experience in electronics or RF hardware

## 🔧 Notes on Printed Parts

Even if you have a 3D printer:
- Some parts **will need to be drilled or widened** to fit actual hardware
- Alignments must be **measured and adjusted manually**
- Real-world tolerances vary between printers and materials
