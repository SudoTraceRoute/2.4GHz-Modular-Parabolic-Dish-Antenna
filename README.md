# 2.4GHz-Modular-Parabolic-Dish-Antenna
3D-printed directional Wi-Fi antenna project with possibilities of various upgrades

This project showcases a **modular, 3D-printed parabolic dish antenna** optimized for 2.4GHz (Wi-Fi band) frequencies. Designed for experimentation and adaptability, it allows easy replacement of the dish, feed, and structural parts to support different frequencies and setups ‚Äî including potential use cases in 5GHz or 5G ranges.

The antenna combines RF engineering principles with practical, low-cost materials and is intended for students, hobbyists, and network engineers interested in wireless signal enhancement.


-**ProjectGoal**

To create a functional, low-cost 2.4GHz directional antenna that is:
- **Modular** ‚Äì parts can be swapped, resized, or upgraded
- **3D printable** ‚Äì accessible and replicable with desktop 3D printers
- **Practical** ‚Äì shows real signal gain in Wi-Fi environments

## ‚öôÔ∏è Design Features

- **Modular construction**: All parts are designed for **easy assembly and replacement**:
  - Swap out dishes of different sizes by unscrewing the holder.
  - Replace or upgrade the feed can for higher frequencies (e.g., 5GHz).
  - Cantenna holder accepts different can diameters.
- **RF-Aware Feed Positioning**: Feed is carefully placed **~49 mm from the can bottom**, accounting for **reflected wave propagation**, not just 1/4 Œª. This corrects a common mistake in similar builds.
- **Insulated Feed Element**: Copper feed is protected with heat-shrink tubing (<0.1 mm thick) to **prevent corrosion** while minimizing any capacitive interference.
- **Effective Reflector Surface**: Dish covered with **aluminum tape featuring conductive adhesive**, ensuring minimal signal loss across the parabolic surface.
- **Robust Stand Design**: Dish and shaft mount on a **metal support rod**, providing the strength to hold larger or heavier components.

## üìä Performance Notes

- The feed is tuned **not by a simple 1/4 wavelength formula**, but based on real reflective path inside the can.
- The copper feed element is covered with **heat-shrink tubing** (less than 0.1mm thick) to prevent corrosion, without significantly impacting electrical properties.
- The dish surface is made conductive to **reduce energy loss** as signals reflect across it.


Preliminary signal strength tests show enhanced directional reception in the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band, with measurable gain compared to typical router antennas. Results may vary depending on local interference and test environment.

## üéØ Why I Built This

This project was part of my hands-on learning in preparation for a career in IT and wireless networking.  
I have no formal IT degree, but I'm building and testing real hardware to deepen my knowledge in RF behavior, Wi-Fi diagnostics, Linux tooling, and network infrastructure.
